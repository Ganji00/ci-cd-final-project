# CI/CD Tools and Practices Final Project

This repository contains the final project for the Coursera course **CI/CD Tools and Practices**.

## Setup

After entering the lab environment you will need to run the `setup.sh` script in the `./bin` folder to install the prerequisite software.

Then you must exit the shell and start a new one for the Python virtual environment to be activated.

```bash
exit
```
